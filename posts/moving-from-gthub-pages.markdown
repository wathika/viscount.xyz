This is my first blog POST after moving to this website from [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

So from the moment I learnt to code, I guess I was lucky enough to know about [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and I immediately spun up
a one-page personal website and that was the coolest thing I had done among my friends. It's a mixture of [Git](https://git-scm.com/)'s version control
and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and I think it's the best way to maintain code and a simple blog.

This website is a layout fork of Tate Johnson's site with minor modifications.
Stay tuned for interesting stuff.
